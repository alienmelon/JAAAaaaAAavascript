JAAAaaaAAavascript is a followup to the critically unacclaimed [AaaaAaaapp.](https://alienmelon.itch.io/aaaaaaaapp) It is the latest in high-tech productivity softwAaaaAaaare.
JAAAaaaAAavascript.js is ideal for websites with lots of text, or written content. As users browse, read, or engage with your page, they will occasionally hear screams of despair.

##Features include:
* Screams coming from your website. (Never let the internet be silent again!)

* Includes gratuitously impassioned exclamations of 'why' and 'no'. Also some coughs (screaming in javascript is hard).

* A pop-up bubble, indicating what the website is screaming about. (this way visitors better understand your website's feelings)

* Cries are somewhat muffled so that you may run this without interrupting user experience. It makes being yelled at a somewhat pleasant experience.

#Are you tired of silent websites?

Implementing JAAAaaaAAavascript is easy! Simply follow these steps:

1) Upload the "JAAAaaaAAavascript" folder in the same directory as your website, or the page you would like to JAAAaaaAAavascript enable.
Once uploaded, add the following beneath your page's < title > tags:

```javascript
<script src="JAAAaaaAAavascript/JAAAaaaAAavascript.js"></script>
```

While doing so you must chant JAAAaaaAAavascript as loudly as possible, else the script will fail.

Once successfully included into your page, call the JAAAaaaAAavascript with "stAAAaaaAAart();" You may also include it in your page's onload event so that it triggers immediately:

```javascript
<body onload="stAAAaaaAAart();">
```

This way people will know that the page has loaded.

You may also initiate JAAAaaaAAavascript by adding the call to a button or href. Your visitors will never know what they could click next in order to make the website scream.

```javascript
<a href="javascript:stAAAaaaAAart()"></a>
```

Be advised: pursuing the above button method means you will spawn multiple entities of JAAAaaaAAavascript, and your website may fall into existential chaos. We are calling this "crisis mode". You are advised to avoid this implementation.

##Note: JAAAaaaAAavascript, and it's predecessor AaaaAaaapp, both use legitimate screams. They are not impassioned yawns, or loudly declared breathing. You can rest assured that you are getting the real thing!
